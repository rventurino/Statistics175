In order to calculate data easily on data sets it seems like I need to keep
said datasets in an object; this will make things easier for a few reasons.

    1.) Automatically assign variables based on type of dataset (grouped, sample, population)
    2.) Save me a lot of time typing everything out.

What do I want out of this program?

I want to be able to give the computer an array of data, and have it do the rest
to make the data intelligible.
Should be able to take a dataset


Basically I need 2 things:
    1.) An iterative table generator to deal with grouping data
        --this will contain the formulas for grouped data, like frequencies, etc.
    2.) A bunch of formulas for all types of data

Should I make the dataset an object or should I make it just an array??

Object:
Would be able to assume certain properties about it like how to sdev and variance
Could become complicated
Couldn't I just do this on the fly if I need data?
If i want to package this up I need an easy system for generating objects.... but I 
also have time constraints because i am really doing this as a supplement for 
my stats class... hmmmmmmmm.

CONCLUSION (For now):
    Skip all formulas dealing with grouped data until a less complicated solution can 
    be worked out. It is simpler this way.
